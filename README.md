Reddit
======

A simple and clean Reddit Crawler. Just enter a subreddit and you're set!

======

Reddit Crawler works entirely with javascript, pulling JSON files via the reddit API and parsing imgur, gfycat, or (optionally) even any image links from the subreddit. You can enter 'help' for more information or 'options' to change some settings. Reddit Crawler can optionally utilize LazyLoad (via unveil.js) to work smoothly on slower systems.
